# Mental Health Social Media Frontend

## Introduction

This is the frontend for my full stack mental health social media app. This app allows a user to create an account, login, logout, create new posts which they are prompted to give an emotion for how they are feeling during that day. 
&nbsp;

This data is stored and using data manipulation, adds up to show the user all their logged emotions in charts, which gives an indication to the user what their most common emotion is during that time period. This app also allows users to add friends, like and comment on posts, update their details and many more features.
